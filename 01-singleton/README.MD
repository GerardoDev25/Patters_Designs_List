# Singleton Pattern

## Description
A singleton pattern is a pattern design that provides a unique instance that is shared through our application.
But nowadays, this pattern is considered an antipattern because its value can be modified by accident, and with the new syntax that we have with ES2015 like `imports, exports` modules and `const, let` keywords is better to work with local variables to avoid change by error
